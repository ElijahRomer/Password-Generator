<h1>Password Generator</h1>

In this project, I was able to utilize skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a basic application that will generate a random string of characters based on a series of specified user criteria, including length, and whether to include different kinds of characters. I experimented on a small scale with CSS animations on the generate password button, adding and removing effects with pseudo classes gradually rather than instantly via the transition property. I was also able to learn about various JavaScript methods involding the Math built in object and expanded my skills with manipulating numbers and writing algorithms in Javascript.
